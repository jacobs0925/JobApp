                            Hello! I'm a college graduate from University of California Irvine with a Bachelor's in
                            Computer
                            Science of Engineering. I'm a passionate and self-driven developer and am looking for an
                            opportunity
                            to work in a professional setting and hone my skills with the help of a team. I have
                            experience
                            with
                            Python, Java, Javascript, and other website development tools.
                            <br><br>
                            I started my programming journey when I was 13 and would write plugins for my favorite game
                            at
                            the
                            time, Minecraft. Not very serious at first, I made fun add-ons for myself and friends and
                            eventually wanted to reach more people with my work. I began reaching out to server owners
                            and
                            soon
                            was developing for pay. Although I felt at the time it wasn't "real" programming, it was my
                            first
                            introduction to Object Oriented Programming and to development with respect to a client's
                            needs.
                            <br><br>
                            I continued with plugin development for a couple more years until I reached college where it
                            took a
                            back seat. I was introduced to Python, APIs, and more advanced computer science principles.
                            With
                            my
                            knowledge of python I began making scripts, again for my self and others. Some of my
                            favorites
                            were
                            a bot for Reddit.com, a text-message-controlled stock trading script, and an mp3 downloader
                            for
                            a
                            roommate
                            who was into music production.
                            <br><br>
                            During my summers I began working at D&D Security where I would unpackage, tag, and flash
                            software
                            onto Chromebooks for a local school district. Although it was nice to work with computers I
                            wanted
                            to write code professionally so after a few years and talking to my manager, I became D&D's
                            Salesforce developer. I was introduced to relational databases as well as some basic HTML,
                            JS,
                            and
                            CSS. With this experience I began making my own simple websites and today I am a freelance
                            web
                            developer.
